### **Additional Tips**
- **Track Your Progress**: Use a document or spreadsheet to track the problems you solve daily.
- **Mock Interviews**: Try mock interviews to get a feel of coding interviews. Platforms like Pramp can help.
- **Consistency**: Stick to the plan and solve problems every day to build momentum.

By the end of this 3-month plan, you should have a solid foundation in DSA and be well-prepared for technical interviews.
